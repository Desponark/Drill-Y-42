  Content: 'Subject: Discovery of Toxic Substance Release during VIOLACEUM Extraction



    Classification:
    Level 4

    Dear Mrs. Bundaberg,



    I am writing to bring to your attention
    a highly concerning discovery made during recent mining operations. Our team,
    while conducting extraction activities in GROUND 0, has identified the presence
    of a toxic substance that is being released into the environment during the VIOLACEUM
    extraction process. The release of the toxic substance poses significant risks
    to human health, wildlife, and the surrounding ecosystem.



    It can contaminate
    surface water, groundwater, and soil, leading to long-term ecological damage.
    The toxic effects may extend to flora and fauna, disrupting natural habitats
    and endangering sensitive species.



    Given the seriousness of this discovery,
    it is imperative that immediate action be taken to minimize further exposure
    and mitigate the environmental impact.



    I recommend immediate suspension
    of all VIOLACEUM extraction operations in the affected area until appropriate
    control measures are implemented.



    I request your immediate attention to
    this matter and would appreciate regular updates on the progress of the proposed
    mitigation measures.



    Yours sincerely,



    Dr. Wollaston, Research Director
    at Nology Inc.'
