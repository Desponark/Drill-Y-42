    From: Cristina Bundaberg To:
    Secretary Tinstan CC: ---

    

    Dear Mr. Tinstan,

    

    I am writing
    to you with utmost urgency regarding a matter of significant importance that
    demands the utmost discretion and strictest confidentiality. As the gravity of
    this situation cannot be overstated, I implore you to treat the contents of this
    letter with the utmost confidentiality and take appropriate measures to ensure
    its secure handling.

    

    Recently, during the VIOLACEUM extraction process,
    an unidentified substance, whose existence can be deemed highly sensitive, has
    been found to be released as a byproduct.

    

    It is crucial that this
    discovery is kept under wraps to avoid any undesired consequences that may arise
    from its public exposure. The nature of this substance makes it exceedingly difficult
    to detect or prove its presence, offering us a unique opportunity to handle this
    matter discreetly. However, it is imperative that we proceed with extreme caution
    and employ a cover-up strategy that ensures no traces of this substance are ever
    found.

    

    I urge you to understand the potential ramifications of this
    revelation becoming public knowledge. The operations of the VIOLACEUM extractions
    and therefore all its economic benefits could be jeopardized if this information
    falls into the wrong hands. Given the potential economic and legal implications,
    it is in our best interest to handle this matter internally and maintain absolute
    secrecy.

    

    In light of the above, I kindly request your expertise
    and assistance in formulating a comprehensive plan to safeguard our organization''s
    interests. We need to ensure that this substance is effectively contained and
    any documentation or evidence related to its discovery is securely archived or
    disposed of.

    

    I trust in your discretion, expertise, and dedication
    to handle this situation effectively.

    

    Yours sincerely,

    

    Cristina
    Bundaberg'
