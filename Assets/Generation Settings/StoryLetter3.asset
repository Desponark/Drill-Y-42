    From: Secretary Tinstan To: Cristina Bundaberg


    Ms.
    Bundaberg,


    The situation is taken care of. Let me assure you that I understand
    the significance of the case. Be sure that you will never hear about the dangers
    of the VIOLACEUM extraction again. I will personally handle Mr. Wollaston. He
    will not be seen again.


    T. Tinstan'
